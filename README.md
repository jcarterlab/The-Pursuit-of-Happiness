# The-Pursuit-of-Happiness

Many people think moving somewhere sunny would make them happier. But research from Nobel prize winning laureate Daniel Kahneman suggests that weather plays virtually no role in our happiness. His findings are supported here with multiple regression analysis using World Happiness Report and Kaggle sunshine hours data. The implication is that even if something makes us happier in the short-run, it might just become our new normal in the long-run.
